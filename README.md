# network_scanner
My own custom network scanner script.

# How to use it:

-In your command console navigate to the folder where you store the script.

-Use the command 'python network_scanner.py -t IP RANGE' ( IP RANGE = for example 10.10.1.1/24)

# Output:

-It will show a table with the IPs and MAC Address of all devices found

# Arguments:

-t or --target =  IP target range

-h or --help = to display the help

Enjoy!
